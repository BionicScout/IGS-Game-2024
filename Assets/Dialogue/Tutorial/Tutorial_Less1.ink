Hey there player. Ready to learn how to play.
First off lets talk about how to move. 
Start by clicking on the character you want to move.
You should then see a button labeld MOVE, click on it!
Some tiles will be highlighted now. That's how far you can move. 
Once you've moved all your characters go ahead and click the END TURN button to let the enemies take their turn.
