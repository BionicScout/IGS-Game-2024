Look at that all healed up!!

Next lets move on. Somethings around the world are able to be interacted with.
For this tutorial it will be the tree, go ahaead and move towards it.
Once you are within a one tile radius click the INTERACT button, the tree should now have a white borader around the tile.
By clicking on the tree you will chop it down letting you cross to the other side of the river.

As always hit the end turn button when you finish.
