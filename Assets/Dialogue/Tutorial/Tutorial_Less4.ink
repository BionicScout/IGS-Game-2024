Sometimes you wont always have healing items.
In that case, you can choose to have a CLERIC on your team, they are a healer.
Instead of attacking they can heal characters close to them for 4 points of health.

Go find your cleric and heal up one of your other characters, by clicking on the ATTACK button and then any character that is on a highlighted tile.
