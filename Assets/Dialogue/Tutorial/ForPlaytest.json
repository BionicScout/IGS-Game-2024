Ready to learn how to play.","\n","^First off lets talk about how to move.","\n","^Start by clicking on the character you want to move.","\n","^You should then see a button labeld MOVE, click on it!","\n","^Some tiles will be highlighted now. That's how far you can move.","\n","^Once you've moved all your characters go ahead and click the END TURN button to let the enemies take their turn.","\n","^You did a great job!!","\n","^So the enemy moved closer to you, its now time to attack.","\n","^But first let go over your charcters stats.","\n","^There again should be a button on your charcters menu called STATS.","\n","^A new menu should pop up, listing all the inportant stats, which will be different for each character.","\n","^The stats include: your characters type, movement range, power, hartyness(defense), health and power range.","\n","^Now lets get on to attacking.","\n","^Very similar to moving there will be a button labled ATTACK, clicking on it will show your attack range.","\n","^If an enemy is on one of the highlighted tiles you can click on them to do some damage.","\n","^Once you've finished with that your going to want to click the end turn button again.","\n","^Nice Kill!!","\n","^Im sorry but for this next lesson we've had to damage your swordsman.","\n","^Go ahead and click on them, you'll see that the health bar has gone donw. Lets fix that!!","\n","^There should be a button labled ITEMS, it works similar to the stast menu.","\n","^Once you see the menu clcik on the first one in the list, it is a healing potion. After you clicked on it a USE button should have apperared, click on that too.","\n","^Lets do a brief rundown of all the items.","\n","^we can skip the heal potion since we just went over that.","\n","^Second in the list is a power buff, it'll increase that characters power for one turn.","\n","^Third is a defense buff, its the same as the power buff but for your defense.","\n","^Forth is a revive which can be used to bring any dead character back.","\n","^Last we have the healing scroll which can heal all you charcters by 4 health points.","\n","^Like always hit the end turn when your done.","\n","^Look at that all healed up!!","\n","^Next lets move on. Somethings around the world are able to be interacted with.","\n","^For this tutorial it will be the tree, go ahaead and move towards it.","\n","^Once you are within a one tile radius click the INTERACT button, the tree should now have a white borader around the tile.","\n","^By clicking on the tree you will chop it down letting you cross to the other side of the river.","\n","^As always hit the end turn button when you finish.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
